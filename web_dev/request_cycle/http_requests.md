What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
GET requests data from a specified resource and POST submits data to be processed to a specified resource. A GET request is used for viewing something, retrieving data without any side-effect without changing it (access an HTML page) and POST is used for changing something, for sending data to the server (save customer information to a database).
