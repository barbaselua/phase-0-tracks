In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
VPS is like a remote computer that is accessed through the internet and is then displayed on your computer. It runs it's own operating system and has it's own files. Advantages of using a VPS:
anything you can do on a computer, you can do with a VPS; if you damage a virtual server, it won't harm the physical server's operation; increased performance and functionality; green tehcnology, environmentally friendly, efficient use of resources; etc.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
There are many reasons to keep one from running programs as the root user. From what the internet says, security is an important one, but for me, newly intorduced to these concepts, human errors (like typos) and malicious programs are pretty good reasons to wanting not to run programs as the root user.
