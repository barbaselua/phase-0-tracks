<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p> I am <strong>Andreea</strong>, from <strong>Chicago</strong>. I like coding and I like dogs. While people today are crazy about <em>cats</em>, I would actually go for <em>dogs</em> anytime. But hey, all pets are awesome.</p>
<p/>Why do I like coding</p>
<ul>
<li>it takes me to the point where I want to open up my window and throw my computer out</li>
<li>it makes me high-five myself 5 minutes later</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do I like dogs?</p>
<ol>
<li>they like to play with you</li>
<li>they don't scratch</li>
<li>they take you out for walks</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever I feel like throwing my computer away or I get scratched by a cat, I look at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pomsky+puppies&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwjQxPjwo63UAhUBImMKHQY_BcYQ_AUIBigB&biw=1366&bih=672">pomsky puppies</a>.</p>
